Deep Learning Final Project Report.pdf: Final Report

paths.npy: A list of relative paths to images that were used as the test set

predicted_masks.npy: Predicted masks from model4 that correspond to the image paths in paths.npy

labels.npy: A list of binary labels 1 (any pneumonia) 0 (normal) which correspond to the paths in paths.npy.  Primarly used in other notebooks to test models that predict pneumonia.

predicted_masks_model6.npy: Predicted masks from model 6 which correspond to the image file in paths.npy

Cropped_Images2: A small set of images that were processed by the final pipeline.  Used for plotting images in the notebook.

Model_Fitting.ipynb: Notebook to fit the Unet model.  May not run all the way through, but should run through the model fitting.

best_model4.keras: Model after the first round of training. Used in final notebook for analysis.

best_model6.keras: Model used in final pipeline.
